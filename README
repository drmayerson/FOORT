Welcome To FOORT!
-----------------

The code files are all in the FOORT subfolder.

See the Documentation pdf for more information on configuration options, how to add your own Metric, Diagnostic, or Termination, and how to process output.


QUICK INSTALL GUIDE:

WINDOWS VISUAL STUDIO:
- Use the Foort.sln Visual Studio solution file and compile the FOORT project therein.


LINUX:
- All code files are in the FOORT subfolder.

- Run "make" in this folder to compile. You will need to have installed the libconfig library beforehand (see the Documentation).

- Alternatively, rename "makefile_precompiledmode" to "makefile" (and rename the original makefile). Then also comment out the line 
#define CONFIGURATION_MODE
at the top of Config.h
Then running "make" should be possible without installing the libconfig library.


OUTPUT:
See in the FOORT/Output file for sample output files and Mathematica notebooks that process (and plot) this output. (The documentation will also have more information in the future.)
